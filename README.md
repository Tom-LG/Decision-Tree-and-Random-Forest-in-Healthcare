# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest-in-Healthcare

I'm delving into the field of machine learning-based medical classification in this lab, using Decision Tree and Random Forest:
Working with the Kyphosis dataset, which includes data on kids who had spinal surgery, will be my task. 

The objective is to create algorithms that can forecast if a youngster undergoing surgery will experience kyphosis, a spinal disorder. The dataset offers three key features: the child's age (in months), the number of vertebrae involved, and the starting vertebra operated on.

This lab allowed me to practive various essential steps of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, to finally see how these models performed in predicting Kyphosis.
